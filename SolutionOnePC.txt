My character ______ is a level ____ _______ with a CON score of _____ and is of ____ race and has/not Tough/Stout feat. I want the HP averaged/rolled.

My character characterName (string) is a level levelNum (integer) charClass (string) with a CON score of conNum (integer) and is of charRace (string) race and has/not Tough/Stout feat. I want the HP averaged/rolled.

Hp is calculated by 
level 1 = hit dice total value + constitution modifier + (2 * (if tough bool = true then 1, if false 0) + (1 * if stout bool = true then 1, if false 0)
each level after 
	average = level1value + (dice roll averaged value (float for .5 values) * level - 1 (to match # of dice)) + conModifier * level-1
	rolled = level1value + (roll class's hit dice # of times equal to level - 1 (to match # of dice)) + conModifier * level-1

toughText = has the Tough feat
toughText = does not have the Tough feat

stoutText = and has the Stout feat
stoutText = and does not have the Stout feat
